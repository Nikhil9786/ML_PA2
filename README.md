# Non-Linear Models SuperVised Learning
This assignment was completed under the course Introduction to Machine Learining(CSE574) in University at Buffalo.

This project consists of two parts;

* **Part I - Sentiment Analysis**
  * Approach 1 - Word Count Vectorization
  * Approach 2 - Neural Network Based Sentiment Classification

* **Part II** - Image Classification on the AI Quick Draw Dataset

This repository contains two .ipynb files for each part
  * > [PA2_Part1.ipynb](PA2_Part1.ipynb)
  * > [PA2-Part2.ipynb](PA2-Part2.ipynb)
  
For the understanding the algorithm followed in detail go through the [PA2_Group7_Report](PA2_Group7_Report.pdf)
